    <!-- <p>If the legend of Brahm's Tower was true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves it would take them around 585 billion years to finish,which is about 42 times the current age of the Universe.</p> -->

    <p>The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Ã‰douard Lucas in 1883. There is a story about an Indian temple in Kashi Vishwanath which contains a large room with three time-worn posts in it, surrounded by 64 golden disks.<p>
<!-- 
    <p>According to the legend, Brahmin priests have been moving Brahama Tower disks in accordance with the immutable rules of Brahma since that time. It was beleived that, when the last move of the puzzle is completed, the world will end.<p>

    <p>In the film Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011), this puzzle, called in the film the "Lucas Tower", is used as a test to study the intelligence of apes.<p> -->
